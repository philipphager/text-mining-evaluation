The triangulate of the current Liverpool side - Gerrard, Alonso, Mascherano - is undoubtedly the toughest central midfield in the world today. Although the Barcelona center with Iniesta and Xavi rivals it due to their superior technical ability, the Liverpool centre has the edge simply because of its shear toughness. Liverpool's status as the best team in European Football over the last 5 years is mainly due to this center and it has now replaced the Milan side of the 00's - Pirlo, Seedorf, Gattuso and Kaka - as the most dominant midfield in European club football today.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "6616     OK! Well I guess i'll go it alone but does anyone ever blame top players for a defeat?  Is it always the manager or the token joke player?  Most criticise Benitez or Lucas but why are the others absolved of any blame?  Torres and Gerrard both missed very easy chances in the first half which surely would have affected the outcome of the game.  The 2nd half team last night was the same team as we've seen all season. It's the same team we saw at Anfield vs Chelsea in the Champions League last season. As a Liverpool fan, occasions that we go ahead and then wilt are few and far between. This season its happened way too much to be an isolated incident. Lyon, Fiorentina, Man City, Birmingham etc. All at Anfield.  I think it would be crazy to sack Rafa. He sets the team up perfectly to play the opposition. The games just mentioned its worked as they have always gone ahead. The problem is after getting a goal they look like they've passing a mine around the pitch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "7982     Slimmer people are more attractive than fat people (on the outside). So....  Please stop writing about how the fashion industry is conditioning us to believe that slim is beautiful and fat is ugly. Its not fashion, its just the truth.  Fashion is an industry that celebrates looking good and not the size of your brain. Good clothes and good looking people. Whats wrong with that?  The people who argue differently are all those that prefer a bar of chocolate to a 5k run. Judging by your picture it looks like you're a chocolate eater and therefore this is an article written for the Daily Mail and no the Guardian.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "8491     In any normal season Man Utd getting a 100m kitty to blow in a single summer would provide months of gossip. This year Fergie has realised that there just aren't any good players left. The Valencia purchase is a strange one, reminds me of his chase of David Bellion, and Im pretty sure most will agree it will have the same outcome. Rafa has seemed to understand this by putting unrealistic bounties on the heads of Alonso and Mascherano. The problem Liverpool would have, like United have now, is who to buy to replace either/or. With Barry gone and Lucas not quite there, anyone else would have to considered as a bit of a gamble. Gambling for the title is something Liverpool don't need this year. With United having already lost half of their goals, if Liverpool maintain their form the title should be theirs. Come on United fans lets here who you want to buy!! None of these players would get into your team last season so is there any point???                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

       "14501    Think Dalglish is going down the SAF route. United have some really ordinary players yet walk the league most seasons. Watch how O'Shea and Brown do at Sunderland this year. Think Liverpool will be much less cautious at Anfield than in previous seasons and go for the win in every game. IF they can get the right balance i think every team in the league will see them as a threat and not enjoy playing them. To get top 4 is still a big ask as they'll have to finish ahead of Citeh, Arsenal, United or Chelski. Whether they can is open to debate but the longer they miss out on the Champions league the harder it will be to get back into.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "14503    Akno The point was about the price not about Chelsea's need for him. Liverpool desperately need a left back but will not spend 35m on one, like they did with Carroll, because it is not a match winning position. Chelsea bought a striker for 50m but will not pay the same for a passing midfielder who contributes little in the final third.  When did Gerrard feed anybody else??!!

       "14504    Modric is worth 50m??  It's simple he's not and never will be because he's a midfielder who doesn't make or score goals. Plus he looks like a bit of a freak so the club won't make on his image.  There is no denying that he is an exceptional player and important to a successful side but he will be of less importance to that side than an out and out goalscorer for example.  I think they'll sell him for 30m. The same price Liverpool got for a similar player in Alonso.  To expect him to supply the bullets for Torres though is short sighted. Remember Alonso fed Gerrard who then fed Torres. Chelsea will need someone in between the two, Kaka possibly??                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

       "16308    spain have won both the european championship and the world cup whilst barcelona have been dominant in the champions league but the history books cloud what actually happened.  spain were the clear favorites for the world cup last year, yet lost their opening game and did an 'arsenal' in the knockout stages by winning every game 1 nill. now im not saying they were lucky, just that they didn't play as well as what people are already 1 year later saying. In 20 years, people will say spain walked the world cup in south africa back in 2010. barcelona beat an average United team in the final of the champions league last season. But in the previous 2 seasons got outthought by both Hiddink and Mourinho. Yes they beat Chelsea but they really shouldn't have done.  the point im making is that this period in history, which will be one glorified as one that spain and barca dominated bar a few decisions or moments could have been very different.  i have nothing against spain or barca, but football evolves, teams will learn to play against them and their dominance will wane unless they evolve.  a tactical article jonathan on how to beat barcelona (because they are the stronger of the 2 teams mentioned) would be a far better read. suggested formations, personnel etc.  personally i'd like to see a team play 3 at the back against them, press them high up the pitch (they have little pace to get in behind) and stick 2 fast, strong players up top.\n",

       "16936    I hope Capello is taken note. Forget counselling John Terry, Capello needs to start watching United so he can change the formation of his England team. After doubts that Rooney could lead a line on his own, it is now imperitive that he now does the same with England. It would allow Heskey to be dropped, Gerrard to move into his favoured postion just off Rooney, and free up the left midfield slot for hopefully an improving Joe Cole.  Surely Gerrard and Rooney up top is the way forward in South Africa. Anyone disagree?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
